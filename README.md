# Final-Project
Tapas &amp; Tranquility


Hello, Group 2,

Good work on this final project. Your code is easy to read and navigate through. I like how each HTML file has its own CSS file which makes the style easier to find. Your site also loads well on the Live Server. 

Some notes I have would be that the nav bar that is on the About page needs to be on each page so that you can navigate through each page easily. Also, make sure to link the pages in the navbar using your <a> tags with the file name that you want to link to.
